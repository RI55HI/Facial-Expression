# Facial-Expression
Recognizing human facial expression live.

## Description
This project is a real-time facial expression recognition system. It uses computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect and analyze human facial expressions live through your webcam.

The project utilizes the DeepFace library and OpenCV to accomplish this task. It detects faces in the video stream, recognizes emotions on those faces, and overlays the detected emotion on the video in real-time.

## Usage
To run this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install opencv-python-headless
pip install deepface
Make sure you have a working webcam connected to your computer.

Run the project using the provided Python script:

python facial_expression.py
The script will open a window displaying the real-time webcam feed with detected emotions overlaid on faces.

To exit the application, press the 'q' key.

Requirements
